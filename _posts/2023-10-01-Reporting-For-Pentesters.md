# I. Facts and ~~Opinions~~ in Analysis

### What is a fact?

-   Something that is objectively true
-   Something that has actually happened
-   Something with a verifiable existence

### Which is better?

-   ~~“The file shares had weak permissions”~~
    -   *“The file share at //fs01 allowed any authenticated user to read and write files to it.”*
-   ~~“The server was running an unsupported version of Nginx”~~
    -   *“The HTTP response headers indicated an unsupported version of Nginx.”* 

### Facts first

-   Make it obvious which systems or components were involved and when.
    -   Timestamp, hostname, source IP, target IP, current username, current privilege level, URL, parameter name, HTTP method etc.
-   If an action was detected, blocked, or otherwise interfered with, say so.
    -   State it when your customer is doing something right. Help them keep doing it!
-   Always validate the answers that you are uncertain of.
    -   Does “`cache-control:no-cache`” mean the user agent won’t cache? (spoiler: the response can be stored in cache!)

### Expert analysis second!

-   “The “Domain Users” group should not have write permission on network file shares” (says who?)
    -   *“Overly-permissive file share permissions can present an attack vector”*
-   “This old web server needs to be patched” (says who?)
    -   *“Outdated systems pose greater risk because they are more likely to include publicly-known vulnerabilities that a low-skilled attacker can exploit.”*

### Beware of using passive recommendations!

-   ~~It is recommended that SSLv3 be disabled.~~
    -   *PCI-DSS prohibits use of SSLv3.*
-   ~~It is recommended to upgrade to the current version~~
    -   *The vendor recommends upgrading to the current version.*
-   ~~It is recommended to disable SMBv1~~
    -   *Microsoft has recommended disabling SMBv1 since 2016.*

# II. Screenshot Rule

-   Establish facts by including screenshots - “Pics or it didn’t happen”
-   Use screenshots as if you are defending this evidence in court.
-   Add plain boxes and arrows to direct attention.
-   Keep text in screenshot about the same size as text around it.

# III. Text Rule

-   Add color or bold or highlighting - something to direct attention
-   Use a different font than the report’s body text so it stands out

#  IV. Clarity

### Audience = Your Readers

-   Never lose sight of who your audience is.
    -   **Technical users**: These are the people who will be fixing the problems you report. Assume they want to learn a little about how you do your thing and instead let them know how to fix it. 
    -   **Management/business users**: These people decide whether to hire you again. They need to know how the technical stuff affects the business and which managerial levers they can leverage on to help.
        -   *Is it a technical fix like installing software updates regularly?*
        -   *Is it a policy or process fix like strengthening password requirements?*
        -   *Is it a system baseline fix like changing weak defaults?*
        -   *Is it a personnel fix like training in secure development or resisting phishing?*

### Strategic Guidance

-   It is recommended [*says who?*] that the organization carefully manage the membership of the local administrators group and avoid adding domain users to this group unless absolutely necessary [*what would be a good justification for doing it?*]. Routine audits of local administrator groups should also be performed [*who should do that? Passive voice can be a no no.*].
